(Verse 1)
Yo, I'm haunted by this monster, call it anxiety,
Slipping from the shadows, continually tries to stifle me,
Got my mind running reckless, can't catch my breath,
Feels like I'm inches away from a sudden death.

Constantly peering over my shoulder, paralyzed,
Got me seeing danger in every single passerby's eyes.
My reality warped, perceptions misconstrued,
Anxiety's a silent killer, got me feeling subdued.

Everyday's a battleground in my mind's zone,
Fighting unseen enemies, trying to reclaim my throne,
Each heartbeat pounds like a ticking time bomb,
This anxiety ain't delicate, far from a psalm.

(Chorus)
Anxiety, anxiety, you ain't no friend of mine,
Stealing my peace, got my sanity on the line,
Anxiety, anxiety, I'm gonna learn to fight,
Shatter your chains, step into the light.

(Verse 2)
Feels like I'm drowning in an open crowd,
Panicking in silence, while the world's too loud,
This ain't no way to live, ain't no way to thrive,
Feels like I'm barely managing to survive.

Got to tame this beast, this uninvited guest,
Imprisoning my spirit, stealing my rest,
But I'm stronger than my struggles, braver than my fears,
Ready to face it, even as my vision blurs.

(Chorus)
Anxiety, anxiety,

[2025-04-13 05:42:07.795426] Debate:
Do humans have an inherent purpose?
For:

1. Teleological Argument: If we consider the perspective of teleology, which is the philosophical doctrine that final causes, design, and purpose exist in nature, then one could argue that humans indeed have an inherent purpose. This purpose, according to many, could be connected to the attainment of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, ethical living, or even spiritual enlightenment.

2. Religious Argument: Many religious viewpoints also suggest that humans have an inherent purpose. For instance, in Christianity, it is believed that humans were created with the purpose to worship God and establish a relationship with Him. Similarly, in Buddhism, the purpose of life is understood to be the attainment of enlightenment.

3. Biological Argument: From a biological standpoint, one could argue that the purpose of any life, including human life, is to survive and reproduce, thus ensuring the continuity of the species.

Against:

1. Existentialist Argument: Existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre have famously argued that 'existence precedes essence', meaning that humans first exist and then each individual defines their own purpose in life. According to this perspective, there is no predefined or inherent purpose in human life.

2. Absurdism: Absurdist philosophy, popularized by Albert Camus, argues that the search for meaning or purpose in life is fundamentally futile because the universe is irrational and meaningless. Thus, from this perspective, humans do not have an inherent purpose.

3. Scientific Argument: In the realm of science, particularly in the field of evolutionary biology, the concept of purpose is not typically applied to biological life. Life is understood more as a result of random mutations and natural selection, not a process guided by any inherent purpose. 

In conclusion, whether humans have an inherent purpose is a deeply complex and multifaceted debate that largely depends on one's philosophical, religious, or scientific perspective. It is not a question that can be definitively answered, but rather serves as a springboard for profound contemplation about
